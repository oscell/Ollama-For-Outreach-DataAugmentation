# Ollama-For-Outreach

## Background

This uses the [Ollama framework](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama). The visoin is to automate the data prep for sending emails adn specialise it to a certain market. This will:

- Clean and standardise data
- Create personalised lines

## Project Outline

### Plan

For a project aimed at cleaning CSV data using large language models (LLMs) like those in the ollama repository, an effective project structure could include:

1. **Programming Language**: Python is a good choice due to its extensive libraries for data handling (like pandas) and integration with machine learning and LLMs.

2. **Files to Create**:
   - `main.py`: The main script to run the application.
   - `data_processor.py`: For loading and preprocessing CSV data.
   - `llm_integration.py`: To handle interactions with the LLM (such as sending queries and processing responses).
   - `utils.py`: For miscellaneous utility functions.

3. **Classes to Include**:
   - `CSVProcessor`: For reading, cleaning, and writing CSV files.
   - `LLMClient`: To manage communication with the LLM.
   - `DataCleaner`: To apply LLM suggestions and refine the data.

4. **Additional Components**:
   - Unit tests for reliability.
   - A configuration file for managing settings.

This structure provides a clean separation of concerns, making the project modular and easier to manage.
